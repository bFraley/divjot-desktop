# Divjot

This is the development repository for the cross platform desktop version of Divjot, a simple and powerful live web editor tool.

The TryDivjot organization was made around developing and shipping this new desktop version of Divjot. There will be a website, releases on the vendor platform stores, and a range of APIs and plugin features coming soon.
